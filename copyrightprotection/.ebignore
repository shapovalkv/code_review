# You can tell the EB CLI to ignore certain files in your project directory with a .ebignore file.
# This file works like a .gitignore. When you deploy your project directory to Elastic Beanstalk
# and create a new application version, the EB CLI will not include files specified by the .ebignore
# in the source bundle that it creates.

# If no .ebignore is present, but a .gitignore is, the EB CLI will ignore files specified in the .gitignore.
# If an .ebignore file is present, the EB CLI will not read the .gitignore.
